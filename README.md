# Retrofit

Retrofit is an awesome type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java built by awesome folks at Square. 
Retrofit makes it easy to consume JSON or XML data which is parsed into Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs).

Dependencies:

    *implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.3.0'
    *implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.3.0'
    
    
# RoomDB

The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
The library helps you create a cache of your app's data on a device that's running your app. 
This cache, which serves as your app's single source of truth, allows users to view a consistent copy of key information within your app,
 regardless of whether users have an internet connection.
 
 Dependencies:
 
     *implementation 'android.arch.persistence.room:runtime:1.1.0'
